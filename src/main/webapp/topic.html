<h3>What is Java technology and why do I need it?</h3>
<p>
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved 
from humble beginnings to power a large share of todayâ€™s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which 
many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue 
to rely on Java, as well.
